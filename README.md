      name: Yaoyuan Shi
            Yixue Zhao

    
## 2. Name of Project
      Car license detection


## 3. Outline goals of the project i.e. indicate the following:
      
    (a) How will the data be collected?
        from Internet https://www.kaggle.com/code/saworz/realtime-plate-reading-video-yolov5-easyocr
        
    (b) What task do you want to accomplish with the data?
        recongnize the numbers and characters on the image of car license
        
    (c) What kind of learning algorithm do you propose using to accomplish this task?
        We going to use Convolutional Network to recognize and analyze the numbers and characters in the pictures and transform into the data accordingly. 
    
    (d) How will you measure your performance of the task?
        If we find some random car license plate and our task is abled to recognize/output the license plate correctly, then we know that our task is   performance well
